# **Statistical Aesthetics**

> **A curated collection of data visualizations that replicate the color palettes and themes of world-famous paintings. This project explores the intersection of art, history, and data science by using meaningful datasets to create beautiful and insightful "data art."**


## Project Philosophy

This repository is an ongoing project to re-imagine classic art through the lens of data. Each visualization is an attempt to find a harmonious blend where the chosen dataset thematically resonates with the masterpiece it seeks to imitate.

### The Mandate of Time: Reign Lengths of Chinese Emperors
This work visualizes the reign lengths of Chinese emperors across dynasties from Xia to Qing. Using R's `ggridges` package, it creates a a ridgeline plot showing the distribution of the length of reign for rulers in all dynasties of imperial China, styled with the iconic blue-green palette of Wang Ximeng's *A Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains* (千里江山图).

- **Data:** Historical records of the reign lengths of 537 Chinese emperors from Xia dynasty to Qing dynasty (Source: Wikipedia).
- **Tool:** R, ggplot2, ggridges (with Gaussian kernel)
- **Art Inspiration:** [《千里江山图》 by Wang Ximeng  (1096–1119, Northern Song Dynasty)](https://www.dailyartmagazine.com/one-thousand-li-of-rivers-and-mountains/)

## Future Work

Planned pieces include:
- Replicating Xu Wei (徐渭, 1521-1593)'s *Peonies* with the combination of chord diagram and hierarchical edge bundling.
- Replicating Claude Monet (1840-1926)'s *Water Lilies* with heatmaps.
