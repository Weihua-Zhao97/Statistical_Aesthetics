Statistical Aesthetics is a curated collection of data visualizations that replicate the color palettes and themes of world-famous paintings. This project explores the intersection of art, history, and data science, using meaningful datasets to create beautiful and insightful "data art." The goal of this ongoing project is to re-imagine classic art through the lens of data. Each visualization is an attempt to find a harmonious blend where the chosen dataset thematically resonates with the masterpiece it seeks to emulate.

### The Mandate of Time: Reign Lengths of Chinese Emperors
This work visualizes the reign lengths of Chinese emperors across dynasties from Xia to Qing. Using R's `ggridges` package, it creates a a ridgeline plot showing the distribution of the length of reign for rulers in all dynasties of imperial China, styled with the iconic blue-green palette of Wang Ximeng's *A Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains* (千里江山图).

- **Data:** Historical records of the reign lengths of 537 Chinese emperors from Xia dynasty to Qing dynasty
- **Data Source:** Wikipedia
- **Tool:** @R `ggplot2` | `ggridges` (Gaussian kernel)
- **Art Inspiration:** [《千里江山图》 by Wang Ximeng  (CN, 1096–1119, Northern Song Dynasty)](https://www.dailyartmagazine.com/one-thousand-li-of-rivers-and-mountains/)

## Future Work ##

Planned pieces include:
- Replicating Xu Wei (徐渭, CN, 1521-1593)'s *Peonies* with the combination of chord diagram and hierarchical edge bundling.
- Replicating Claude Monet (FR, 1840-1926)'s *Water Lilies* with heatmaps.
